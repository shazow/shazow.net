      <title>Beginner Sourdough: Does anything really matter?</title>

      <description>There are bazillions of sourdough recipes in the wild, foaming with traffic from eager bakers trapped in quarantine, ready for their sourdough starter baby with a punny name to graduate into a tube of sustenance and distraction during dark times.
Sourdough recipes are more involved than regular bread recipes, that‚Äôs for sure. There are many steps, and bakers can‚Äôt seem to agree on many of them. That‚Äôs no accident, a great sourdough bake needs to be adjusted to our kitchen and our starter.</description>

      <title>Open sourcing urllib3‚Äôs finances</title>

      <description>Since urllib3 was created in 2008, we have gained several amazing maintainers and hundreds of contributors. Any time you do anything that touches HTTP in Python, you‚Äôre probably using urllib3 behind the scenes. It is the 2nd most downloaded third-party Python package, after pip.
Tens of thousands of engineering hours were donated by people working on their own time, unpaid. The whole world benefited from these important donations.</description>

      <description>I spent fifty hours setting up my new computer, and I feel a mixture of shame and pride about it.
We spend a lot of our lives in our computers. Working, socializing, relaxing. On the work laptop, at the home desktop, on the phone in bed.
We live in our computers, and we do little things to make ourselves feel more at home in them‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa little more cozy. We change the wallpaper, install some new apps, buy a pretty case and some stickers for the back.</description>

      <description>After maintaining a project for many years, maybe you‚Äôre no longer using it yourself? Or maybe you‚Äôre burned out from the grind? Or you can‚Äôt afford to allocate time to it? Maybe it‚Äôs time to pass it on to somebody else.
I feel like there is more to learn from failure stories than success stories, so let‚Äôs start with those.
What not to do I‚Äôve handed over several projects before, and some didn‚Äôt go as well as I‚Äôd hoped.</description>

      <description>It has been over two months and I feel better.   My first tweet.
 I haven‚Äôt tweeted in over two months.
This is very unusual for me. I‚Äôve been an avid tweeter since 2007. Writing tweets has become a part of my identity to the point where most my bios mention that I‚Äôm a tweet ghostwriter‚Äîcomposing and editing tweets for friends is one of my favourite things to do.</description>

      <description>A case study between Python and Go. In Go, a common complaint from newly-minted gophers who come from another language is the error handling pattern: result, err := DoSomething() if err != nil { return nil, err }``another, err := SomethingElse(result) if err != nil { return nil, err }``// We can be a bit more terse if we don&amp;amp;#39;t need to save any // variables outside of the if-scope: if err := MoreWork(another); err !</description>

Popular password managers work by maintaining an encrypted database of many secrets, protected by a combination of the master password and access to the encrypted database file that is synchronized across your devices.</description>

      <description>Neither self nor this: Receivers in Go When getting started with Go, there is a strong temptation to bring baggage from your previous language. It‚Äôs a heuristic which is usually helpful, but sometimes counter-productive and inevitably results in regret.
Go does not have classes and objects, but it does have types that we can make many instances of. Further, we can attach methods to these types and they kind-of start looking like the classes we‚Äôre used to.</description>

      <description>In a few months, the first iteration of modern consumer virtual reality headsets are going to start shipping. A lot is rapidly changing and new applications are being discovered every week.
I present three stories that use VR technology to push our crafts beyond what was possible. Each story is focused around an amazing short video that is very much worth watching.

      <description>The goal of designing a public API response layout is to balance ease of use for consumers with commitment of stability from the provider. We can bolt on all kinds of crazy metadata and embedded values that we‚Äôll regret having to maintain years later, like complex pagination schemes that don‚Äôt scale for evolving domain spaces or when we‚Äôre finally Web Scale and wasting millions on extra bandwidth from that emoji soup we thought would be hilarious to wrap each entry with.</description>

      <description>SSH, how does it even?
A few weeks ago, I wrote ssh-chat.
ssh http://t.co/E7Ilc0B0BC pic.twitter.com/CqYBR1WYO4
&amp;mdash; Andrey ü¶É Petrov (@shazow) December 13, 2014  The idea is simple: You open your terminal and type, $ ssh chat.shazow.net
Unlike many others, you might stop yourself before typing ‚Äúls‚Äù and notice‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat‚Äôs no shell, it‚Äôs a chat room!
While the little details sink in, it dawns on you that there is something extra-special going on in here.</description>

      <description>Urllib3, Stripe, and Open Source Grants Helping the future come a little soonerSix years ago, I built a better Python http library. It had then-novel things like connection pooling, thread-safety, multipart encoding, and more. Today, every Python user depends on it. Maintaining something for six years on my own time is not easy, even with a slew of coping strategies. A few hours here and there, every week, and slowly it chugs along‚Äîlargely thanks to contributors undertaking the bigger tasks that I can‚Äôt knock off in a quick afternoon.</description>

 Thank you for being open to public discourse.
I am a passionate believer in the importance and imminence of virtual reality‚Äôs effects on our society. I was devastated when I read the news about Facebook acquiring OculusVR, and this is why:
Ecosystem The Oculus Rift was more than a timely piece of clever technology‚Äîit was a powerful rallying cry to which hundreds of developers and manufacturers answered the call.</description>

Do I want to build a venture capital funded startup? A sustainable humble life-style business? An innovative independent game studio? A wildly-profitable consulting enterprise? Perhaps follow in the foot-steps of 37Signals, Github, Twitter, or Google?
Or maybe I would be happy working for somebody else but I just haven‚Äôt found the right place?</description>

      <description>Excerpt from README.rst
How to maintain a successful open source project Lessons learned from five years of maintaining one of the most-used Python libraries. I‚Äôve published dozens of open source projects over the years, mostly in Python and JavaScript. Few are old and stable, others are new and immature, some are wildly popular with a constant stream of contributors, but most linger until one day a trickle of users suddenly discover them.</description>

      <description>Considering job offers? A checklist in alphabetical order Every offer you get will include some details and omit others. To perform a proper comparison between multiple offers and reach a good decision, you&amp;rsquo;ll need all the details for all offers. After numerous back-and-forths with several companies, I composed a checklist ideal for anyone on the verge of deciding the next stage of their career.
 Benefits: Medical, dental, vision. Yes, you&amp;rsquo;re young and healthy, but root canals are much more painful when you&amp;rsquo;re paying for them out of your pocket.</description>

      <description>Password Management Utilities We live in a time when cleartext usernames and passwords are leaked on a daily basis. In the last couple of months my accounts got compromised on Gawker, Sony, and MtGox. I decided it&amp;rsquo;s time to start using the one-password-per-service technique. These are tools I found in my research.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently using SuperGenPass, but considering writing my own version that uses customizeable multipass sha512, more symbol breadth in passwords, and some other improvements.</description>

      <description>Arbitrarily-Structured Data in Relational Databases This approach is similar to FriendFeed&amp;rsquo;s schemaless database framework. The key difference is in the data locality.
The goal is not to build an effective schemaless database on top of a relational database, but rather to accomodate for rapidly-evolving relational schemas and reducing the difficult of migrating forward.
Hypothesis In an evolving relational (SQL) database schema, we store two types of data: Data we will be querying against and data we will be displaying.</description>

      <description>Rules of thumb for novice designers (like myself) My strategy as a novice designer is to keep track of some rules of thumb to reduce the probability of making bad mistakes from lack of experience. If I&amp;rsquo;m careful enough, then I can often get to a point where just a little polish from an experienced designer is what it takes to get it from the 80% to the 100% mark.</description>
