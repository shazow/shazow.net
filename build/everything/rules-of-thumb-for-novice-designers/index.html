        <h1 id="rules-of-thumb-for-novice-designers-like-myself">Rules of thumb for novice designers (like myself)</h1>
<p>My strategy as a novice designer is to keep track of some rules of thumb to reduce the probability of making bad mistakes from lack of experience. If I&rsquo;m careful enough, then I can often get to a point where just a little polish from an experienced designer is what it takes to get it from the 80% to the 100% mark.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep a <strong>grid</strong>, always align to the vertical columns, but also strive to align to the horizontal rows if possible. For web design, using a CSS framework will help with this. I like <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint</a> but there are many others like <a href="http://960.gs/">960</a> which is more to the point.</li>
<li>Pay attention to <strong>rhythm</strong>: Bigger spacing interlaced with small spacing creates two rhythms instead of one. One rhythm is better than two unless there&rsquo;s a good reason.</li>
<li>Be <strong>consistent</strong>. This includes the chrome, grid, colors, button types (link vs form button vs div), etc.</li>
<li>Err on the side of more <strong>spacing</strong>. Try more first, if it looks weird then try less.</li>
<li>Err on the side of <strong>simplicity</strong>. Question the existence of specific elements, get rid of them if they&rsquo;re not absolutely necessary. You&rsquo;re better off having your users not know how to do one obscure task than to be overwhelmed and not do any of the simple common tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Blend colors</strong> (use <a href="http://colorblendy.com/">ColorBlendy</a> or Photoshop equivalent). Colors on top of each other (think foreground/background) look more organic if they have an element of each other within them. I typically pick a background color (e.g. light blue like #abc) and a monochromatic foreground color (e.g. dark grey, #333) and multiply. This gives me the foreground color I should use with the light blue (ie. dark blue with a light blue).</li>
<li>Avoid too many lines like separators, boxes, containers. Having incoherent details adds complexity and &ldquo;busy-ness&rdquo; to the interface. Instead, use empty space and arrangement. This is similar to adding too much punctuation to your writing.</li>
<li>Focus on one primary user flow you&rsquo;re optimizing for at a time. You rather the user be able to do the most important thing really easily than to be able to do everything kind of difficultly.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to build a beautiful interface that is completely unusable, and it&rsquo;s possible to build an utilitarian and maybe unbeautiful interface which is very usable. I would aim to do the latter until you&rsquo;re ready to hire a designer. It&rsquo;s likely that the designer will have to rethink a lot of it from scratch as that&rsquo;s just part of the design process, but that&rsquo;s about as much as you can hope for.</p>
<p>These design guidelines have helped me reduce the designed-by-a-programmer effect when building consumer applications.</p>
