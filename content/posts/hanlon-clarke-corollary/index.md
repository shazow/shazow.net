I went into a deep research hole trying to discover the origin of the quote:

> "Any sufficiently advanced incompetence is indistinguishable from malice."

tl;dr: Earliest online record of this quote is by Vernon Schryver on May 1, 2002.

## Grey's Law, 1996?

Wikipedia, LLMs, and various random blog posts cite it as "Grey's Law" which I haven't been able to corroborate.

Wikipedia [references a book from 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws#cite_note-Gooden2015-7) which refers to the quote as "Grey's Law" but attributes it to "unknown author". I couldn't find an actual source for someone named Grey, and closest "Grey" reference I've found mentioned is a Youtuber named [CGP Grey from 2010+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGP_Grey).

Meanwhile, Rationalwiki's Talk section on Grey's Law has [an anecdotal story](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Talk:Grey's_Law) from someone who claims to have made that quote in the 90's under a handle related to Grey:

> [...] I have a distinct memory that some point in the very late 90's or early 00's was the first time (for me) that I posited the maxim "any sufficiently advanced incompetence is indistinguishable from malice," with explicit crediting of Clarke and Hanlon. [...]

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find actual archives of posts with this quote from the 90s.

## Vernon Schryver, 2002

Earliest online record of this quote is by Vernon Schryver on May 1, 2002 on in the `news.admin.net-abuse.email usenet` newsgroup, which has sadly been purged by Google Groups but luckily archive.org still has a snapshot:

## Napoleon-Clarke Law, 2004

It was later dubbed the "Napoleon-Clarke Law" by Paul Ciszek on October 11, 2004 in the `rec.arts.sf.fandom` usenet group. Paul explains later in the same thread:

> Well, Napoleon said something about not attributing to malice that which is adequately explained by incomptence, and Clarke said that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. So far as I know I am the first one to put them together and call it the Napoleon-Clarke law.

After finding some of the pieces pointing to Vernon Schryver and Paul Ciszek, I stumbled on this excellent overview thread by Kevin J. Maroney in Sept 25, 2005 on the `rec.arts.sf.fandom` newsgroup that is worth a read: https://groups.google.com/g/rec.arts.sf.fandom/c/1JaqxckrAOc/m/xO5jzyejK1UJ

## Hanlon-Clarke Corrolary

We later reattributed Napoleon's quote to [Hanlon's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor).

Coming back full circle with Grey's anecdote who correctly attributed the mashup to Hanlon and Clarke, I'm going to take this opportunity to further rebrand Vernon's quote as the Hanlon-Clarke Corollary.

Until we can find better corroboration of Grey's anecdote (please reach out if you have a lead!), I say we attribute this quote mashup to Vernon Schryver.
