I wrote [my own static site generator](https://github.com/shazow/composer) once
upon a time. It had some good ideas, but I haven't maintained it in a while.

I have become a big fan of the Go community in recent years and
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is one of many excellent projects to have come from
it.

This is my first post using Hugo.
